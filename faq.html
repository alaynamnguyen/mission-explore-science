            <p>On the Mission: Xplore Science website, go to the Projects tab at the top of the page. Select whichever subject interests you (Astronomy, Biology, Earth Science, Nature, Oceanography, or Physics). Then, on each project page, click on a project which interests you and read the “Overview” to see if you are a good fit. Consider the difficulty level, whether you need adult assistance, and possible skills you can gain. If you like it, then follow the steps provided on the “Instructions” tab.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Sometimes, you will be required to do certain projects. If you are searching for a project on your own, however, there are many ways to decide which projects will interest you. If it is one of your first projects, try doing a topic which may seem more familiar to you. Generally, this could be Earth Science or Nature. If you are willing to explore new areas of interest, then feel free to look through all the subjects and do whichever project that catches your interest - there is no limit to the amount of projects you can do. A helpful tool for unfamiliar subjects is the “Learn More” section of each project, where you can watch videos and do worksheets to help your understanding.</p>

            <p>As emphasized in the About Us page, Mission: Xplore Science is by no means a substitute for classroom learning time. Our goal is to help students explore Citizen Science projects and encourage them to participate in the scientific community as elementary-school students. Citizen Science projects can act as supplemental learning material and projects on the side while following the curriculum, and can be a fun activity to do outside of home. However, these activities can be a great initiative to dive deeper into certain topics, especially in the “Learn More” section of each project.</p>

        <button type="button" class="accordion-button"> How can I incorporate citizen science projects into the classroom?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>While Mission: Explore Science currently only has 6 main topics, many of these projects overlap with many other areas of science. These projects can be introduced along with new subjects in the curriculum, especially through using resources in the “Learn More” section. Each project compiled also has a Skills Gained section at the bottom of the Overview. These can be important in deciding which project or activity to introduce and have the class familiarize themselves with before working on it at home.</p>
